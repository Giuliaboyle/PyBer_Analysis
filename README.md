# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a visual representation of the data to better compare rural, suburban, and urban cities rides.

Total rides, total fares, and total drivers all increased, as cities became more urban. This is likely due to the increase in population in these cities. Average fare per ride and average fare per driver all decreased as the cities became more urban. The more rides there are, the cheaper they can go for to create the same amount of profit. 
## Summary
This data could be used in three potential ways:

The company could slightly incresae the fare in urban areas due to the face that 2/3 of rides are in urban areas.  A small increase could go a long way with the amount of rides in urban cities. 

Try to hire more drivers in suburban and rural areas. The rides in rural and suburan areas are most expensive so there is more to profit if they can have more rides. 

Consider instialling a pay/mile business plan in suburban and rural cities since the driving distance is much greater and there are less rides.
